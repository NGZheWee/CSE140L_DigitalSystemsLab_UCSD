# CSE140L: Digital Systems Laboratory (Spring 2023, UCSD)

This repository contains coursework from **CSE140L: Digital Systems Laboratory**, which I took in Spring 2023 at UC San Diego. The course focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of digital systems using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog.

## Contents:

- **Labs**: Contains lab assignments focused on the design and testing of digital circuits, including combinational and sequential logic using Verilog.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Combinational Logic**: Designing circuits that do not have memory, such as multiplexers, decoders, and adders.
- **Sequential Logic**: Working with circuits that have memory, like flip-flops, counters, and finite state machines (FSMs).
- **Hardware Description Language (HDL)**: Using Verilog to describe and simulate digital circuits.
- **FPGA Programming**: Implementing and testing digital designs on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).
- **Timing and Performance**: Analyzing circuit timing, delays, and optimizing for performance.

## How to Navigate:

- **Labs**: You can find all lab assignments under the `Labs/` directory, each containing Verilog code and simulation results for designing various digital circuits.


Explore the coursework to see how digital systems are designed, simulated, and implemented using hardware description languages and FPGA programming.
